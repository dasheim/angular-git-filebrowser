This is work in progress - but if you can't wait to test it you should run:

```
npm install
npm start
``` 

navigate your browser to `http://localhost:4200`

Click the `clone` button to clone the selected repository. Access to github is via a proxy that can be configured using `proxy.conf.json` (change to another organization then fintechneo if you want to test your own repositories).
